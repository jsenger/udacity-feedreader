# RSS Feed Reader

This is a project for Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree. It was used to develop my testing skills with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). The application is a RSS feed reader with a few feed options.

## Running the application

To run the app just download the files and open index.html in any browser. Everything inside the 'jasmine' folder is just for tests, it's not needed to run the feed reader.

## Contributing

Since the purpose of the project was to develop my testing skills, I would be happy to receive any tips on that part of the code so I can improve it. You could do that by creating issues or in any other way you find better :)
